##About
**MDAG** (Minimalistic Directed Acyclic Graph) is a **Java library** capable of constructing character-sequence-storing, directed acyclic graphs of minimal size.

The library is small, deceptively simple, fast, and powerful. It differs from other libraries capable of creating minimal directed acyclic graphs
(also known as **MA-FSA** (Minimal Acyclic Finite State Automata) or **DAWG**s (directed acyclic word graphs)) in the following ways:

- Graphs are constructed directly from input (instead of from a preliminarily constructed trie)
- Graphs can be constructed from unsorted input
- Graphs can be constructed from either files or collections
- Graphs can be modified on the fly (words can be added and/or removed from the represented lexicon)
- Graphs can be "simplified" in to an array for even more space-savings
- Out of the box convenience methods are provided for perusing the graph:

The code well structured, easy to follow, and extensively commented for the
benefit of developers seeking to understand the data structure, as well as
developers seeking to add homogeneous, functionality-extending code with ease.

The code has also been fully tested for correct functionality and performance.

##How to use

    MDAG myMDAG = new MDAG(new ArrayList<String>()); //Overriden constructor also accepts a file
    
    //Add a single String to the lexicon
    myMDAG.addString("str0");
    
    //Add a collection of Strings to the lexicon
    myMDAG.addStrings(Arrays.asList(new String[]{"str1", "str2", "str3"}));
    
    //Remove a String from the lexicon
    myMDAG.removeString("str0");
    
    //Deterine if the lexicon contains a given String (O(n) based on input)
    boolean doesContain = myMDAG.contains("str0"); //false
    
    //Get all Strings starting with "str1" (O(n) based on input)
    HashSet<String> startingWithSet = myMDAG.getStringsStartingWith("str1"); //{"str1"}

    //Get all String ending with "2" (O(n) based on dictionary)
    HashSet<String> endingWithSet = myMDAG.geStringsEndingWith("2"); //{"str2"}
    
    //Get all String containing "r3" (O(n) based on dictionary)
    HashSet<String> containingSet = myMDAG.getStringsWithSubstring("r3"); //{"str3"}
    
    //Get all Strings
    HashSet<String> entireSet = myMDAG.getAllStrings(); //{"str1", "str2", "str3"}
    
    //Simpify graph structure in to an array (further space reduction)
    myMDAG.simplify();

##Licensing and usage information

MDAG is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Informally, It'd be great to be notified of any derivatives or forks (or even better, issues or refactoring points that may inspire one)!

More informally, it'd **really** be great to be notified any uses in open-source, educational, or (if granted a license) commercial contexts.
